## Problem

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

```
Input: "()"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

Example 3:

```
Input: "(]"
Output: false
```

Example 4:

```
Input: "([)]"
Output: false
```

Example 5:

```
Input: "{[]}"
Output: true
```

## Solutions

1. Initialize a stack S.
2. Process each bracket of the expression one at a time.
3. If we encounter an opening bracket, we simply push it onto the stack. This means we will process it later, let us simply move onto the sub-expression ahead.
4. If we encounter a closing bracket, then we check the element on top of the stack. If the element at the top of the stack is an opening bracket of the same type, then we pop it off the stack and continue processing. Else, this implies an invalid expression.
5. In the end, if we are left with a stack still having elements, then this implies an invalid expression.

Java Solution:

```java
class Solution {

  // Hash table that takes care of the mappings.
  private HashMap<Character, Character> mappings;

  // Initialize hash map with mappings. This simply makes the code easier to read.
  public Solution() {
    this.mappings = new HashMap<Character, Character>();
    this.mappings.put(')', '(');
    this.mappings.put('}', '{');
    this.mappings.put(']', '[');
  }

  public boolean isValid(String s) {

    // Initialize a stack to be used in the algorithm.
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      char c = s.charAt(i);

      // If the current character is a closing bracket.
      if (this.mappings.containsKey(c)) {

        // Get the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, set a dummy value of '#'
        char topElement = stack.empty() ? '#' : stack.pop();

        // If the mapping for this bracket doesn't match the stack's top element, return false.
        if (topElement != this.mappings.get(c)) {
          return false;
        }
      } else {
        // If it was an opening bracket, push to the stack.
        stack.push(c);
      }
    }

    // If the stack still contains elements, then it is an invalid expression.
    return stack.isEmpty();
  }
}
```

Python Solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """

        # The stack to keep track of opening brackets.
        stack = []

        # Hash map for keeping track of mappings. This keeps the code very clean.
        # Also makes adding more types of parenthesis easier
        mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

        # For every bracket in the expression.
        for char in s:

            # If the character is an closing bracket
            if char in mapping:

                # Pop the topmost element from the stack, if it is non empty
                # Otherwise assign a dummy value of '#' to the top_element variable
                top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'

                # The mapping for the opening bracket in our hash and the top
                # element of the stack don't match, return False
                if mapping[char] != top_element:
                    return False
            else:
                # We have an opening bracket, simply push it onto the stack.
                stack.append(char)

        # In the end, if the stack is empty, then we have a valid expression.
        # The stack won't be empty for cases like ((()
        return not stack
```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : O(n) because we simply traverse the given string one character at a time and push and pop operations on a stack take O(1) time.
* Space complexity: O(n) as we push all opening brackets onto the stack and in the worst case, we will end up pushing all the brackets onto the stack. e.g. ((((((((((.
